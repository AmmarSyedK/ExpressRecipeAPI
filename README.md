# Building an API using Express.js and deploying it to Vercel
This API was built as a backend for a recipe application using Blazor. It was designed to fetch all the recipe data required by the front-end of the application. The API was built using Express.js and is deployed on Vercel.

# API Endpoints
The API has the following endpoints:

GET /recipes: Returns a list of all the recipes.

# API Access
The API is deployed on Vercel and is accessible at https://recipe-api-five.vercel.app/recipes.

# API Design
The API was built using Express.js, a popular Node.js web framework. The API uses a RESTful architecture, where the endpoints correspond to CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data. The API stores the recipe data in memory, which means that the data will not persist after the API is restarted.

# API Documentation
The API uses JSON as its data format, and the endpoints accept and return JSON data. The API uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. The API documentation provides more detailed information on the request and response formats for each endpoint.
